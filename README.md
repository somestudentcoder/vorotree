## Data Model ##

The tool supports JSON and CSV files which need to have the following format in order to visualize the data properly.

- **Name** is used as the label of the polygon.
- **Weight** influences the size of the polygon. Only the leaves should have this property. If the weight is not given, the size of the polygon depends on the amount of children.

### JSON Example ###


```json 

{
      "name": "America",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "North America",
          "children": [
            {"name": "United States", "weight": 24.32},
            {"name": "Canada", "weight": 2.09},
            {"name": "Mexico", "weight": 1.54}
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "South America",
          "children": [
            {"name": "Brazil", "weight": 2.39},
            {"name": "Argentina", "weight": 0.79},
            {"name": "Venezuela", "weight": 0.5},
            {"name": "Colombia", "weight": 0.39}
          ]
        }
      ]
}


```

### CSV Examples ###

To create a Voronoi Treemap from a CSV file, the columns **name** and **parent** are required. The **weight** is optional as described above. 

```
 name,parent,weight
 cars,,
 owned,cars,
 traded,cars,
 learned,cars,
 pilot,owned,40
 325ci,owned,40
 accord,owned,20
 chevette,traded,10
 odyssey,learned,20
 maxima,learned,10
```

However if parents are not unique, the tool requires **id**, **name** and **parentId** to create a hierarchy from this data set.

```
id,name,parentId,weight
1,Father,,
2,Alice,1,
3,Alice,1,
4,Bob,2,10
5,Doris,3,20
```
